4 oz. packaged dried corkscrew macaroni (about 1 c.)
8 oz. skinless boneless chicken breast
nonstick coating spray
1/8 tsp. salt
1/8 tsp. pepper
4 plum tomatoes, halved lengthwise and sliced
1 small zucchini and/or yellow summer squash, halved lengthwise and sliced
1/4 c. sliced green onions
2/3 c. reduced-fat or fat-free clear Italian salad dressing
1/4 c. snipped fresh basil

Cook macaroni according to package directions, except omit any oil and use 1/4 teaspoon salt. Drain pasta. Rinse with cold water; drain. Meanwhile, rinse chicken and pat dry with paper towels. Cut chicken into 1-inch pieces. Spray an unheated large skillet with nonstick coating. Preheat over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Remove chicken from heat. In a large mixing bowl, toss together cooked macaroni, chicken, tomatoes, zucchini or summer squash and green onions. Drizzle with salad dressing. Sprinkle with basil. Toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 6 hours. Toss salad before serving. Makes 6 servings.
