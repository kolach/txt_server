2 lb. hamburger meat
2 cans cream of mushroom soup
2 cans cream of chicken soup (be sure it's condensed)
1 or 2 cans green chilies, chopped (optional)
1 whole moon Cheddar cheese
1 onion
1 bag round tortilla chips

Preheat oven to 350Â°. Brown hamburger and drain grease. Mix all soups and green chilies with meat; stir and simmer until hot. Grate cheese and cut your onion up (not too small). You'll need a large, deep pan. Put some chips in the pan (enough to cover bottom). Put some mixture on top of the chips (use sparingly). Put onion and cheese over this; do not mix together. (Be sure and save some onion and cheese.)

After the cheese, you'll repeat it: chips, mixture, onion and cheese (lots of cheese). Put in oven for 30 minutes or until cheese is melted. Great with picante sauce, refried beans, rice, etc.
