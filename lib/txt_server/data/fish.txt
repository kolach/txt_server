1/3 c. bulgur wheat
1/2 tsp. instant chicken bouillon granules
1/2 c. water, boiling
1/2 lb. fresh skinless orange roughy, flounder or pike fillets (about 1/2-inch thick)
1/4 tsp. garlic salt
1/4 tsp. dried basil, crushed
1 c. loose-pack frozen broccoli, baby carrots and water chestnuts or frozen cauliflower, broccoli and carrots
1/2 small tomato, chopped
2 Tbsp. dry white wine

Combine bulgur and bouillon granules in a 10 x 6 x 2-inch baking dish and pour boiling water over the top. Place fish on top, tucking under any thin edges. Sprinkle with garlic salt and basil. Place frozen vegetables and tomato on top of fish; drizzle with wine. Cover tightly with foil and bake in a preheated 450Â° oven for 25 to 30 minutes (fish should flake easily with fork).
